====================================

Your task is defined as follows:

	- Implement the count_paths_with_even_weights function in tree.c.
	- Write unit tests for that function.


count_paths_with_even_weights
=============================
Suppose we have the following tree:

		1
	       / \
	      2   3
             / \   \
            5   4   6

A path shall be defined as any ordered set of tree nodes {x1, x2, ..., xN} where
x1 is the root of the tree, xN is any node in the tree, and for any i between 1
and N, x(i + 1) is a child of x(i). Thus, in the example above, the paths are:

	{1, 2, 5}
	{1, 2, 4}
	{1, 2}
	{1, 3, 6}
	{1, 3}
	{1}

The weight of a given path of a tree shall be defined as the sum of the values
of all nodes in the path. NOTE THAT THE VALUE OF A TREE NODE MAY BE NEGATIVE.
Your count_paths_with_even_weights function should compute the number of paths
that have even weights. In this example, that number would be 3: {1, 2, 5},
{1, 3, 6} and {1, 3} all have even weights.


Testing
=======
You will need to be able to create various trees to write good unit tests.
You can always create the trees manually, but that's tedious. Best is if you
build the trees using your build tree function from PA08 in combination with
input files. Feel free to add helper functions to tree.c and tree.h.


Submission
==========
To submit you work, do just like you did for exam 2, navigate back to the parent
of your final exam directory, and compress the final exam directory with:

	zip -r <final exam directory>.zip <final exam directory>

where <final exam directory> is the name of that directory. Submit the zipped
folder through the final exam quiz on Brightspace.
